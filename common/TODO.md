* Write a small frontend with a text box and an output field
* Switch to Text instead of String wherever possible
* Put pretty printing in a separate module
* Better pretty-printing
* Allow adding assumptions (probably using let definitions and a term for assuming)
* More informative error messages for type checking and parsing
* Fix the equality eliminator
* Add uninhabited type, unit, (dependent) product, coproduct, lists, vectors of fixed size, etc.
* Maybe switch to bidirectional type checking to allow less type annotations, and to allow more documentation by allowing type annotations in arbitrary places
