* Allow let-definitions and assumptions (for adding axioms)
* Better pretty-printing
* More informative error messages for type checking and parsing
* Add uninhabited type, unit, (dependent) product, coproduct, natural numbers, lists, vectors of fixed size
* Add "admit" to allow easy unfinished proofs
* Maybe switch to bidirectional type checking to allow less type annotations, and to allow more documentation by allowing type annotations in arbitrary places
